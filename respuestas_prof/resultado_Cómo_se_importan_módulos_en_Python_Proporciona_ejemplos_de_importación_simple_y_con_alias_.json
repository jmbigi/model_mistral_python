  "question": "¿Cómo se importan módulos en Python? Proporciona ejemplos de importación simple y con alias.",
  "answer": "Los módulos se importan en Python usando la declaración import. Ejemplo: import math. También se puede utilizar un alias, por ejemplo, import math as m.",
  "score": "\nThe model you described seems like a well-designed AI assistant for teaching Python and software programming to students. The focus on personalized learning, content analysis, error identification, and providing specific suggestions are all important aspects of effective teaching. Additionally, the ability to create exercises and provide personalized feedback is crucial in helping students improve their understanding of the subject matter.\n\nRegarding the task you mentioned, I can certainly assist with that. For example, if you have a list of 10 questions and answers about Python programming, I can help you identify which questions are most difficult or require further clarification. Based on this analysis, we can prioritize which questions should be covered in more detail during the lesson.\n\nI can also assist with creating quizzes and evaluations for students. For instance, I can generate randomized questions that test their knowledge of specific concepts, such as data types, control structures, or functions. These questions can then be scored automatically and provide instant feedback to the student.\n\nLastly, I can help you with content creation by suggesting new topics or activities based on student performance. For example, if a particular concept seems to be challenging for students, we can create additional exercises or examples to reinforce their understanding of that topic."
